# ⚡️ ENS Dart

A dart library that wraps the Ethereum Name Service.

The Ethereum Name Service is analogous to the Domain Name Service. It enables users and developers to use human-friendly names in place of error-prone hexadecimal addresses, content hashes, and more.

- Interop with `web3dart` package
- Get ENS name from ETH address
- Get address from ENS name
- Get contentHash
- Get textRecord
- Call functions on ENS smart contracts and listen for contract events

## Usage

### Get ENS name and address

ENS Dart provides an interface to look up an address from a name, the reverse, and more.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  env.load('../.env');
  final infuraKey = env.env['INFURA_KEY'];

  final rpcUrl = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/$infuraKey';
  final wsUrl = 'wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/$infuraKey';

  final client = Web3Client(rpcUrl, Client(), socketConnector: () {
    return IOWebSocketChannel.connect(wsUrl).cast<String>();
  });

  /// ENS client
  final ens = Ens(client: client);

  /// Get name from address
  final name = await ens
      .withAddress('0x1a5cdcFBA600e0c669795e0B65c344D5A37a4d5A')
      .getName();

  /// Get address from name
  final addr = await ens.withName('brantly.eth').getAddress();

  /// Get text record
  final textRecord = await ens.getTextRecord();

  print('name: $name'); // name: sea.eth
  print('addr: $addr'); // addr: 0x324f9307b6d26881822c7c8692eeac39791a9756
  print(
      'textRecord: $textRecord');  /* EnsTextRecord {

For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?" - Jesus, Luke 9.23-25,
